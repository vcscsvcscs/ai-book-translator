# Translate books with LLMs

The original project seems abadoned so i am making this fork, feel free to contribute.

This project harnesses the power of LLMs to translate eBooks from any language into your preferred language, maintaining the integrity and structure of the original content. Imagine having access to a vast world of literature, regardless of the original language, right at your fingertips.

This tool not only translates the text but also carefully compiles each element of the eBook ‚Äì chapters, footnotes, and all ‚Äì into a perfectly formatted EPUB file. We use the `gpt-4-1106-preview` (GPT-4 Turbo) model by default to ensure high-quality translations. However, we understand the need for flexibility, so we've made it easy to switch models in `main.py` according to your specific needs.


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To install the necessary components for our project, follow these simple steps:

```bash
python -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
```

Remember to add your OpenAI key to `config.yaml`.


## üéÆ Usage

Our script comes with a variety of parameters to suit your needs. Here's how you can make the most out of it:

### Show Chapters

Before diving into translation, it's recommended to use the `show-chapters` mode to review the structure of your book:

```bash
python main.py show-chapters --input yourbook.epub
```

This command will display all the chapters, helping you to plan your translation process effectively.

### Translate Mode

#### Basic Usage

To translate a book from English to Polish, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py translate --input yourbook.epub --output translatedbook.epub --config config.yaml --from-lang EN --to-lang PL
```

#### Advanced Usage

For more specific needs, such as translating from chapter 13 to chapter 37 from English to Polish, use:

```bash
python main.py translate --input yourbook.epub --output translatedbook.epub --config config.yaml --from-chapter 13 --to-chapter 37 --from-lang EN --to-lang PL
```


## Converting from AZW3 to EPUB

For books in AZW3 format (Amazon Kindle), use Calibre (https://calibre-ebook.com) to convert them to EPUB before using this tool.


## DRM (Digital Rights Management)

Amazon eBooks (AZW3 format) are encrypted with your device's serial number. To decrypt these books, use the DeDRM tool (https://dedrm.com). You can find your Kindle's serial number at https://www.amazon.com/hz/mycd/digital-console/alldevices.


## ü§ù Contributing

We warmly welcome contributions to this project! Your insights and improvements are invaluable. Currently, we're particularly interested in contributions in the following areas:

- Support for other eBook formats: AZW3, MOBI, PDF.
- Integration of a built-in DeDRM tool

Join us in breaking down language barriers in literature and enhancing the accessibility of eBooks worldwide!
